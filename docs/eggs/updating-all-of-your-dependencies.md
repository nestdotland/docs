title: Updating all of your dependencies
---

You can easily update your dependencies and global scripts with the `update` command.

```shell script
eggs update [deps] <options>
```

Your dependencies are by default checked in the `deps.ts` file (current working directory). You can change this with `--file`

```shell script
eggs update # defaults to deps.ts
eggs update --file my_dependencies.ts
```

By default, all your dependencies are updated. You can choose which ones will be modified by adding them as arguments.

```shell script
eggs update # Updates everything
eggs update http fs yolk # Updates only http, fs, yolk
```

Scripts installed with `eggs install` can also be updated with the `-g` parameter.

```shell script
eggs update -g # Updates every script installed with eggs install
eggs update eggs denon -g # Updates only eggs denon globally
```

Several registries are supported. We currently support:

- x.nest.land
- deno.land/x
- deno.land/std
- raw.githubusercontent.com
- denopkg.com

:::tip

If you want us to add support for another registry, [open an issue](https://github.com/nestdotland/eggs/issues/new/choose) specifying the registry; we'll consider adding it!

An example of a dependency file:

```ts
import * as colors from 'https://deno.land/std@v0.55.0/fmt/colors.ts';
import * as bcrypt from 'https://deno.land/x/bcrypt@v0.2.0/mod.ts';
import * as eggs from 'https://x.nest.land/eggs@v0.1.0/mod.ts';
import * as http from 'https://deno.land/std/http/mod.ts';
```

After `eggs update`:

```ts
import * as colors from 'https://deno.land/std@0.62.0/fmt/colors.ts';
import * as bcrypt from 'https://deno.land/x/bcrypt@v0.2.1/mod.ts';
import * as eggs from 'https://x.nest.land/eggs@0.3.10/mod.ts';
import * as http from 'https://deno.land/std/http/mod.ts';
```
