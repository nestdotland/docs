title: Installation
---

To publish your first module to nest.land, you will need our CLI, **eggs**. You can install it using this command:

```shell script
deno install -Afq --unstable https://x.nest.land/eggs@0.3.8/eggs.ts
```

Please make sure to use the `-A` flag to grant all permissions to eggs, so you can enjoy all features seamlessly.

To ensure that you fully understand all the new features of the latest versions,
make sure to read the [releases](https://github.com/nestdotland/eggs/releases) page!

> Note: You need to upgrade to Deno v1.6.0 or newer in order to use our CLI.
