title: Linking your API key
---

In order to publish modules to the blockchain with our CLI, you must first generate an API key. See [Getting Started](https://nest.land/#start).

After you generate your API key, you need to add it in the CLI. To do this, type:

```shell script
eggs link <your key>
```

This will save your API key on your local machine. Now you will be able to publish modules to the blockchain without logging in ever again.

Keep your API key safe and **DO NOT** share it with anyone. You cannot create a new key once you loose the old one.
