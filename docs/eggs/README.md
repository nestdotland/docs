# Eggs CLI
The eggs command line interface allows developers to easily manage and publish modules on [Nest.land](https://nest.land).

**Eggs** is written in TypesScript, utilizing the power of Deno. It's lightweight yet efficient, and it provides an easy and safe way for developers to manage their modules.

It is also open-source, so check it out on [Github](https://github.com/nestdotland).
